# Ride-Share Analysis

Kate is looking to start a bike share program in her hometown of Des Moine, Iowa after having a great experience with one during a vacation to New York City. Kate has a potential seed investor, and has requested my help to discover and display information about how the bike sharing program works in New York City, and how that will translate to Des Moine.
